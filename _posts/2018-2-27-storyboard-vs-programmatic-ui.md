New and veteran iOS and macOS developers have debated about this topic for years.  With the fast pace updates of Xcode every year on the Storyboard Editor (previously known as Interface Builder), and the introduction of Swift opinions have shifted back and forth.  It is not the intent of this post to weigh in on the pros and cons of either paradigm.  Every app developers build is to address a particular problem - provide a solution best for a dilemma in the most efficient way possible.

To consider one paradigm as preference tries to generalize all development struggles to be the same across all domains.  In the real world we all know that is not true.  Look at the plethora of third party Swift libraries for UI Animations for example.  They implement different approaches using the native UIKit framework.  Every problem has a different solution.  A developer should then have all available knowledge and skills to address many potential problems he encounters when creating great apps.  Sticking to one paradigm will lock you out in solving half the problems out there.

If there’s more than one way to skin a cat won’t you rather know how?
