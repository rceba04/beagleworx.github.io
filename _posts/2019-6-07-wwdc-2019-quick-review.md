The Apple World Wide Developers Conference 2019 is about to end its annual showcase of new strides in Apple's technology stack.  I'm excited to see new tools and advances in Xcode to simplify my work and help me focus on designing great app solutions.  I have listed highlights of the keynote.

**Catalyst** Much talk has come around on Marzipan apps to unit iOS and Mac apps as a simplified development platform for developers.  WWDC revealed that it just becomes a checkbox to build iPad apps into macOS apps.  I haven't tried it yet but with the introduction of **SwiftUI** framework and the various design sessions in WWDC to bridge the gap between UI paradigms in iPad apps and macOS I believe it all makes a lot of sense.

**iPadOS** For years the term *Universal apps* seemed to just describe an expanded iPhone app to fit in iPads but this year it becomes a whole new OS framework on its own - just like **tvOS** and **watchOS**.  Multi-user support and new multitasking UI paradigm - it redefines how developers build iPad apps.  It bridges the capabilities of iOS and macOS too with providing **Catalyst** configuration options.

**SwiftUI** Declarative UI development - an approach to build UIs to be *described* than programmatically building it (animation, transition, elements) - has become popular over the years.  Apple building on to this trend and providing a cross-platform tool to build UIs has me excited - yes, SwiftUI allows you to build screens that seamlessly translate across iOS, iPadOS and macOS.  This convenience and pairing it up with the new **Combine** binding framework can reduce coding in as much as a quarter of what used to build standard screens.

**ARKit** This year Apple pushes further with easier tools for developers to build *Augmented Reality* apps.  The new **ARKit 3** framework provides new capabilities: multi-face tracking, front-and-back camera simultaneous use, enhanced object-tracking (even body parts too).  With *RealityKit* and *RealityBrowser* it will allow developers to have smoother learning curve to explore and implement augmented reality apps.  Apple has made wide strides in the last 3 years in augmented-reality than any other company, but it has helped build the momentum across all platforms to push AR further - maybe investing on it as the future of technology especially on mobile and wearables (something *Google* has tried to push but hasn't quite took off well).

There are a lot of other things in the WWDC that I look forward to but the key items above reverberates to developers more.  In the coming weeks I'd explore more on the capabilities of **SwiftUI** and **ARKit**, and maybe a few *Machine Learning* technologies as well.  We'll write up more of the WWDC 2019 for juicy bits of new technology you can use for your new ideas for mobile apps.  Stay tuned.
